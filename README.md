# 💫 About Me:
As a recent graduate in Computer Science and Engineering (Data Science) from R. C. Patel Institute of Technology, I’ve developed a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and programming. My academic journey was driven by a deep interest in solving real-world problems using data, backed by coursework and hands-on training in Python, SQL, and advanced data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI. With a consistent passion for analytics, I’ve complemented my education with certifications in Machine Learning, Java Full Stack, Big Data, and AWS Cloud to build a well-rounded technical skill set.<br><br>During my academic career, I worked on multiple real-time projects that apply AI and data science to practical domains. My key projects include a Real Estate Price Prediction and Recommendation System using ML and NLP, a Crop Recommendation Model based on weather and soil data, and a Food Delivery Chatbot to automate customer interactions. These experiences allowed me to integrate data preprocessing, predictive modeling, Flask APIs, and user-centric design—all valuable assets in business and tech environments. I also co-authored a research paper on real estate analytics published in a peer-reviewed journal, showcasing my ability to combine academic rigor with technical execution.<br><br>Looking ahead, I aim to launch my career as a Data Analyst or ML Engineer, with a strong interest in supply chain optimization, business intelligence, and AI-driven decision-making. I’m eager to contribute to forward-thinking organizations that value innovation, efficiency, and data-driven strategies. I’m open to remote and international opportunities where I can continue learning, solving problems, and creating impact through data.
